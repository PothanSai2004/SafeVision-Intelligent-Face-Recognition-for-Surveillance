# **VisionGuard: AI-Driven Face Recognition Security**

## **Overview**
VisionGuard is an AI-powered face recognition security system designed to enhance surveillance by identifying individuals in real-time. Utilizing OpenCV and deep learning techniques, it ensures robust and efficient facial authentication.

## **Features**
- üöÄ **Real-Time Face Detection** using OpenCV
- üîç **Face Recognition** with deep learning-based models
- üîê **Access Control** ‚Äì Grant/Deny access based on recognition
- üì∏ **Automated Image Capturing** for logging unauthorized access attempts
- üìä **Accuracy-Based Identification** to minimize false positives

## **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, dlib
- **Database:** SQLite / Firebase (optional for logging access)

## **Installation & Setup**
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- dlib (`pip install dlib`)
- TensorFlow/Keras (`pip install tensorflow`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

### **Steps to Run the Application**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VisionGuard.git
   cd VisionGuard
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the face recognition system:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## **Usage**
- **Register Faces:** Add authorized users to the database.
- **Run Surveillance:** The system continuously scans and matches faces in real-time.
- **Log Unauthorized Access:** Unrecognized faces are logged with timestamps.
