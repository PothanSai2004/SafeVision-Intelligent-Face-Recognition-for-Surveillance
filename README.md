🚀 AI-Powered Smart Surveillance System
A real-time face recognition-based security solution enhancing surveillance with AI-powered authentication.

📌 Overview
The AI-Powered Smart Surveillance System leverages deep learning and OpenCV to detect and recognize faces, enhancing security in real-time. This system can be integrated into CCTV networks, access control systems, and restricted areas to ensure authorized access and prevent unauthorized intrusions.

🎯 Features
✅ Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition using OpenCV and deep learning.
✅ High Accuracy Authentication with AI-driven facial recognition models.
✅ User Database Management for authorized personnel.
✅ Surveillance Integration for continuous monitoring.
✅ Alerts & Logging for unrecognized or unauthorized individuals.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Deep Learning (FaceNet/dlib)
Flask (for web-based UI)
SQLite / Firebase (for user authentication and face storage)
